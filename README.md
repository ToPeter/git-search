# git-search

Simple CLI aimed at 'usage research' backed by GIT.

## Mission

It is often needed to find out 'how many projects (repos, people) are using this framework, this api etc...

It seems that the results achievable by using gitgub search API are not satisfactory (see problems section),
so we implement this mini project as workaround.

## Stories

- gulp vs. grunt
- test frameworks used in node.js projects (mocha, vs. tap)
- ...


### gulp vs. gunt

To find 'repos using gulp' run the following command:

	TODO: command line

To find 'repos using frunt' run the following command:	
	
	TODO: command line
